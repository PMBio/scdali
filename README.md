# scDALI 

scDALI (single-cell differential allelic imbalance) is a statistical model and analysis framework that leverages allele-specific analyses of single-cell data to decode cell-state-specific genetic regulation.

Please have a look at the [scDALI website](https://pmbio.github.io/scdali) for more information on installation and usage!
